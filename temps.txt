I love u
We can only learn to love by loving
True love stories never have endings
The day I met you for the first time is still fresh in my memories
I wish that you always stay close to me and keep making me feel lucky every day
I may not have told you, but I want to tell you that you have given my life a purpose
Falling in love with you has been the best thing for me in this life
Thank you for choosing and loving me beyond conditions
I have found the love of my life in you
I was so alone in this whole wide world, but I found a companion for life in you when you arrived
You have changed my life, and you have made me a happy and blessed person
###
You may not know, but you are the only one who will rule my heart
When I see you, I feel like to see angel falling opposite the moon
No matter how old I get, my love will grow with each passing day
When you are with me, smiles and joy are surrounding me
I sometimes wonder if I was living a life when you were not with me because after you have arrived, you have made my life so full of love, care, and affection
There will be no day when I will not be loving you and pampering you because you mean the world to me
My heart only beats for you, and my eyes always look for you
You are the most special person who completes me in every sense
Every moment that I spend with you becomes a beautiful memory of my life
Every time you look at me, the sparkles in your eyes steal my heart
When I first met you, I had no idea that we would have a future together, but I am glad that we transformed from strangers to lovers
I may have never expressed it, but I want you to know that you mean the world to me
It was never easy to find true love in life, but I am fortunate to find you
###
All the happiness and success that I enjoy today, is all because of the love you have showered me with
I promise to love you unconditionally forever
Falling in love with you has been the most beautiful accident of my life
Had you not been there with me, I would have been a lost soul who has no idea what I was missing
Having your hand in mine is the only thing I had ever wanted
